Project Frontline – 3D Mobile Strategy Prototype

60-day Unity 3D mobile strategy game prototype inspired by modern RTS titles.

Built with Unity URP targeting iOS and Android.

This repository documents the full development process from foundation setup to mobile deployment.


Project Goal

Build a polished, playable 3D strategy prototype including:

- 3D battlefield
- Player-controlled base
- 3 unit types
- Enemy AI system
- Combat mechanics
- Resource economy system
- Mobile optimization pipeline
- iOS & Android builds

This is a vertical slice prototype — not a full multiplayer production.
